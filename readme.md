# URL Shortener / Redirector

The main idea is to demonstrate the parsing of YAML and URL re-directing.

## Usage

1. `go run main.go`
2. Navigate to `localhost:8080/x`, `localhost:8080/google`, `localhost:8080/wikipedia`, `localhost:8080/go` from the browser. The program will re-direct to these websites using the full URL.
